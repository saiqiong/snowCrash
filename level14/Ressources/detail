1. there is no file, after tried many small things, starting to try with gdb with getflag
	gdb -g getflag
2. disass main #Dump of assembler code for function main
	since getflag is printing a pass, focus on put write function
	start from end of the dump aroud many put, the next line is always jump to <main + 1257> , this 1257 must br somehow special
4. set a break point from the main function , jump to 1257's address
5. b main
	run 
	jump *0x08048e2f
	got stack smashing detected ***: /bin/getflag terminated, and nothing.
	then need to try a address which is before that, but around put or write , of course not the address with jump to 1257
6. after tried many with jump to address 0x08048de5
	got 7QiHafiNa3HVozsaXkawuYrTstxbpABHD8CPnHJ is the pass for flag14
7. with getflag we have      7QiHafiNa3HVozsaXkawuYrTstxbpABHD8CPnHJ
