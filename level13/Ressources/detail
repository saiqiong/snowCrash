1. we run ./level13 we got UID 2013 started us but we we expect 4242
	if we do ll, we see level13 binary owned by flag13, we certainly don't have the right.
2. when we do nm or strings level13 we know this program is using getuid for check the uid
2.	gdb -q ./level13 # -q to not display gdb informations
	disass main # Dump of assembler code for function main
	 # we can see  0x080485a1 address is calling getuid
	  #so need to set a break point before that address which is 0x0804859f
	break *0x0804859f
	run
		#we see   0x080485c6 is calling exit probabaly when the uid is not rig		ht, so we wanna jump directly to address after this which is 0x080485cb
	jump *0x080485cb
3. here we hv the token 2A31L79asukciNyi8uppkEuSx
